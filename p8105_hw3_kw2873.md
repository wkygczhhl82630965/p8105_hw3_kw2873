How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
## there are 134 different aisles id
instacart %>%
select(aisle_id) %>%
  distinct() %>%
  summarize((n_obs = n())) 
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 1
    ##   `(n_obs = n())`
    ##             <int>
    ## 1             134

``` r
## the most popular aisle is aisle 83 which has been ordered 150609 times
instacart %>%
select(aisle_id) %>%
  count(aisle_id) %>%

  number_of_aisle = n
) %>%
  arrange(desc(number_of_aisle))

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
### problem with the order
instacart %>%
select(aisle_id) %>%
  count(aisle_id) %>%
  arrange(desc(n)) %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>%
mutate(
   aisle_id = factor(aisle_id),
  ) %>%
  # arrange(desc(n)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = aisle_id, y = n,color = aisle_id )) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Plot of Aisles Ordered More Than 10000 Items",
    x = "Aisle ID",
    y = "Number of Items Ordered"
  ) +
   viridis::scale_color_viridis(
    name = "Aisle ID", 
    discrete = TRUE
  ) +
   theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables
fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your
table.

``` r

pvf =
instacart %>%
  filter(aisle == "packaged vegetables fruits" )  %>%
  select(aisle, product_name) %>%
  count(aisle, product_name) %>%
  arrange(desc(n))  %>%
  filter(n > 4059) 

##generating dataset for dog food care with top 3 items

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r

format the data to use appropriate variable names; focus on the “Overall
Health” topic include only responses from “Excellent” to “Poor” organize
responses as a factor taking levels ordered from “Poor” to “Excellent”

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

``` r
brfss %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent")  %>%
  select(year,state,location,data_value) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  group_by(year,state) %>%
  summarize(ave_within_state_overtime = mean(data_value)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year,y = ave_within_state_overtime,color = state)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(
    title = " Plot of Average Data Value Over Time Within a State ",
    x = "Year",
    y = " BRFSS Data Value Within State From 2002 to 2010",
    caption = "Data from BRFSS "
  )
```

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r

select (year, state,location,response,data_value)  %>%
filter (response %in% c("Excellent","Very good","Good","Fair","Poor"),
        year %in% c("2006","2010"),state  %in%  c("NY")) %>%
  group_by(location)%>%
ggplot(aes(x = response,y = data_value,color = location))+ geom_boxplot()+ facet_grid(~year)

Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset should
include all originally observed variables and values; have useful
variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and encode data
with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting dataset
(e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

``` r
accel_data = read_csv(file = "./data/accel_data.csv")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

``` r
tidy_accel_data = 
accel_data %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
rename(nth_day = "day_id") %>%
pivot_longer(
  activity_1:activity_1440, ## choose the column you want to combine
  names_to = "nth_minute",  ###name the new-made column
  names_prefix = "activity_",
  values_to = "activity" 
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    day_1 = day,
    day_1 = recode(day, "Monday" = "1" ,"Tuesday" = "2", "Wednesday" = "3", "Thursday" = "4", "Friday" = "5", "Saturday" = "6", "Sunday" = "7"),
 weekday_weekend = case_when(   ## "case when" is helpful when you want to create one variable based on two or more levels 
      day_1 <= 5 ~ "weekday",
      day_1 >5 ~ "weekend",
      TRUE     ~" " ## blank for anything that doesn't satisfy the above situation
    )) %>% 
  select(-day_1)
```

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
tidy_accel_data %>%
  group_by(nth_day,weekday_weekend) %>%
  summarize(
    total_activity = sum(activity)
  ) %>% 
 knitr::kable()
```

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.
